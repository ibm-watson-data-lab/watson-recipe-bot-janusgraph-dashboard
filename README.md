# Watson Recipe Bot Dashboard

The Watson Recipe Bot Dashboard is a web application that shows conversations with the 
[Watson Recipe Bot](https://github.com/ibm-cds-labs/watson-recipe-bot-nodejs-janusgraph) as they are happening in realtime.
Here is a sample screenshot of the dashboard:

![Watson Recipe Bot Dashboard](screenshots/dashboard1.png?rev=2&raw=true)

### Quick Reference

The following environment variables are required to run the application:

```
JANUSGRAPH_URL=https://xxx.composedb.com:yyyyy
JANUSGRAPH_USERNAME=admin
JANUSGRAPH_PASSWORD=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
GRAPH_ID=recipebot
SNS_API_URL=http://my-simple-notification-service.mybluemix.net
SNS_API_KEY=NDc4gxGdqhWyaX
```
We will show you how to configure the necessary services and retrieve these values in the instructions below:

### Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required to run the dashboard:

1. A running instance of the [Watson Recipe Bot (with JanusGraph)](https://github.com/ibm-cds-labs/watson-recipe-bot-nodejs-janusgraph).
2. A running instance of the [Simple Notification Service](https://github.com/ibm-cds-labs/simple-notification-service).

To run locally you will need Node.js 4.3.2 or greater.

To push your application to Bluemix from your local development environment you will need the [Bluemix CLI and Dev Tools](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/starters/install_cli.html).

Before continuing please follow the instructions for setting up the Watson Recipe Bot w/ JanusGraph and the Simple Notification Service,
including setting up the appropriate Bluemix services such as JanusGraph and RethinkDB.

### Running the Dashboard Locally

If you haven't already installed Node.js you can install it by following the instructions [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

From the command-line cd into the watson-recipe-bot-janusgraph-dashboard directory (clone it first if you haven't already):

```
git clone https://github.com/ibm-cds-labs/watson-recipe-bot-janusgraph-dashboard
cd watson-recipe-bot-janusgraph-dashboard
```
 
Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Copy the .env.template file included in the project to .env. This file will contain the environment variable definitions:

```
cp .env.template .env
```

Copy and paste the following values from the .env file in your Watson Recipe Bot:

```
JANUSGRAPH_URL=https://xxx.composedb.com:yyyyy
JANUSGRAPH_USERNAME=admin
JANUSGRAPH_PASSWORD=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
GRAPH_ID=recipebot
```

In the .env file enter the URL for the Simple Notification Service. If you deployed the SNS to Bluemix it will look something like this:
 
```
SNS_API_URL=http://my-simple-notification-service.mybluemix.net
```

If you are running the SNS locally it will look something like this:

```
SNS_API_URL=http://localhost:6016
```

Skip ahead to the **SNS API Key** section below to generate an SNS API Key. When generating the key use **localhost** as the Hostname.
This is the hostname for the client that will be connecting to the SNS (which is this application, the dashboard).
In this case we are running the dashboard locally.

### Deploying the Dashboard to Bluemix

```
cd deploy
cp cf_setenv.sh.template cf_setenv.sh
```

Open cf_setenv.sh in a text editor.
Change *<EMAIL>* to be your Bluemix email address.
Change *<ORG>* to be the name of your organization in Bluemix  where you would like to deploy the dashboard (the organization name may be the same as your email address).
Change *<SPACE>* to be the name of the space in your organization where you would like to deploy the dashboard.

```
cp ../.env .
```

Run the deploy script:

```
./cf_depoy.sh
```

### SNS API Key

Once you have the Simple Notification Service running you will need to generate an API key that will be used by the Watson Recipe Bot and the dashboard.

1. Go to the Simple Notification Service in your web browser (ex: http://my-simple-notification-service.mybluemix.net/)
2. Click **Adminstration** in the left nav.
3. Under *Add a New Key*  enter the hostname for the dashboard. If you are running the dashboard locally use *localhost*.
If you are running the dashboard in Bluemix use your Bluemix path (ex. *my-simple-notification-service.mybluemix.net*).  
4. Click **Generate Key**:

    ![SNS](screenshots/sns_apikey1.png?rev=1&raw=true)

5. Click **Submit**. You should see your API key show up under **Existing Keys**: 

    ![SNS](screenshots/sns_apikey2.png?rev=1&raw=true)
    
6. Take note of the key. You will use this to set the SNS_API_KEY variable in the .env files for the dashboard and the Watson Recipe Bot.

Continue to the appropriate section below to finish running the dashboard locally, or deploying to Bluemix.

### Running the Dashboard Locally, cont.

 Once you have an SNS API Key add it to the .env file like so:

```
SNS_API_KEY=NDc4gxGdqhWyaX
```

Start the dashboard:

```
npm start
```

Note the URL for your dashboard in the output:

```
server starting on http://localhost:6015
```

Open this URL in your browser. Then follow the **Watson Recipe Bot Configuration** steps below.

### Watson Recipe Bot Configuration

Stop your Watson Recipe Bot application if it is running. Edit the .env file and add the following entries:

```
SNS_API_URL=http://my-simple-notification-service.mybluemix.net
SNS_API_KEY=NDc4gxGdqhWyaX
```

Set **SNS_API_URL** to the URL for your Simple Notification Service and set **SNS_API_KEY** to the SNS key generated above.

Restart your Watson Recipe Bot and start chatting with sous-chef.
If everything is working properly you should start seeing Users and Actions in the dashboard.

## Privacy Notice

This application includes code to track deployments to [IBM Bluemix](https://www.bluemix.net/) and other Cloud Foundry platforms. The following information is sent to a [Deployment Tracker](https://github.com/cloudant-labs/deployment-tracker) service on each deployment:

* Application Name (`application_name`)
* Space ID (`space_id`)
* Application Version (`application_version`)
* Application URIs (`application_uris`)

This data is collected from the `VCAP_APPLICATION` environment variable in IBM Bluemix and other Cloud Foundry platforms. This data is used by IBM to track metrics around deployments of sample applications to IBM Bluemix to measure the usefulness of our examples, so that we can continuously improve the content we offer to you. Only deployments of sample applications that include code to ping the Deployment Tracker service will be tracked.

### Disabling Deployment Tracking

Deployment tracking can be disabled by removing or commenting out the following line in `app.js`:

`require("cf-deployment-tracker-client").track();`
